For the current version, we adopted the following analysis strategies:

1. Use literature-based genes (with no further gene selection procedure)

2. Perform NMF and use the following number of clusters for each cluster:
   HCCDB1
   HCCDB
   HCCDB
   HCCDB
   HCCDB
   HCCDB

3. Detection signatures of each cluster
   Method: anova
   Threshold: 1e-5
   Candidate gene sets: all literature genes

4. Count the number of datasets that some signature was observed

5. Detection gene modules based on previous signatures
