# HCCDB_Subtypes

Based on our HCCDB database, which collects public available HCC gene expression datasets, we perform a signature network clustering-based methods, to integrate all these datasets to make HCC subtyping.

The main steps contain:

(1). Single datasets clustering and signature detection

(2). Signature network construction and clustering

(3). Re-classify single datasets based on consensus signature classes
