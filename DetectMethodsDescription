We try new detection methods now:

Given number of clusters, cluster assignment and gene exp. matrix, 

###	  detect representative genes of every single cluster by:

###   For a specific cluster k ,compare it with all others seperately 

###   1. Detection of significantly differential expressed genes:
###    (1). t.test (fdr<1e-5) and
###    (2). wilcoxon.test (fdr<1e-5)
###   2. Higher expression than other clusters
###
###   The intersection of all comparision results as final signals


### i.e. if there exitst 3 clusters, the signature of cluster 1 is defined as: 1v2, 1v3 differentially expressed and has higher mean expression


### The first version: we used v0506 (hsa05200) clustering results (stored at ~/HCCDB_Subtypes/results/v0616_v1_sigs/)
