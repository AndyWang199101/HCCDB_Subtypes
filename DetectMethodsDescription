We try new detection methods now:

Given number of clusters, cluster assignment and gene exp. matrix, 

###	  detect representative genes of every single cluster by:

###   For a specific cluster k ,compare it with all others seperately 

###   1. Detection of significantly differential expressed genes:
###    (1). t.test (fdr<1e-5) and
###    (2). wilcoxon.test (fdr<1e-5)
###   2. Higher expression than other clusters
###
###   The intersection of all comparision results as final signals


### i.e. if there exitst 3 clusters, the signature of cluster 1 is defined as: 1v2, 1v3 differentially expressed and has higher mean expression


### The first version: we used v0506 (hsa05200) clustering results 

### and (a). test genes in this pathway(stored at ~/HCCDB_Subtypes/results/v0616_v1_sigs/)
###     (b). test all literature-based genes (~/HCCDB_Subtypes/results/v0616_v2_sigs/)
###     (c). test all measured genes (~/HCCDB_Subtypes/results/v0616_v3_sigs/)


### 06.21 update:
### We use ANOVA pre-selection the differentially expressed genes;
### The representative gene of some cluster has highest mean expression among all clusters.

### only test genes in this pathway (stored at ~HCCDB_Subtypes/results/v0616_aov_hsa05200_sigs/)
### test all literature-based genes (~HCCDB_Subtypes/results/v0616_aov_pubmed_sigs/)
### test all measured genes (~HCCDB_Subtypes/results/v0616_aov_sigs/)
